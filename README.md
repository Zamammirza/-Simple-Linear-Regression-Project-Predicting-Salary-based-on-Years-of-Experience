Simple Linear Regression Project: Predicting Salary based on Years of Experience

Overview:
This project involves implementing Simple Linear Regression to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience. The dataset used for this project is 'Salary_Data.csv', containing two columns: Years of Experience (independent variable) and Salary (dependent variable).

Project Steps:
Data Import and Exploration:

Imported necessary libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.
Loaded the dataset ('Salary_Data.csv') using Pandas to analyze and explore the data structure.
Data Preprocessing:

Separated the independent variable (Years of Experience) and the dependent variable (Salary) from the dataset.
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from Scikit-Learn.
Model Training:

Utilized Scikit-Learn's LinearRegression class to train the Simple Linear Regression model on the training set.
Prediction:

Predicted salary values for the test set using the trained model.
Visualization:

Plotted visualizations for both the training and test sets to showcase the linear regression line against the actual data points.
Libraries Used:
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: Used for splitting the dataset and implementing the Linear Regression model.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the application of Simple Linear Regression in predicting salaries based on years of experience. The visualizations provide a clear representation of how well the model fits the training and test data.
